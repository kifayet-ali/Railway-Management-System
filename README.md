🚂 Railway Reservation Management System (RRMS)
A desktop application built using C# Windows Forms and Oracle Database that simulates a complete train ticket booking and management system. This project was developed as part of a university assignment to demonstrate Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and Database Management System (DBMS) integration.

📁 Project Structure
Frontend: Windows Forms (C# .NET Framework)

Backend: Oracle Database

Architecture: Multi-form desktop application with secure DB connectivity

🧠 OOP Principles Applied
Encapsulation: Each form encapsulates specific functionality (e.g., ReservationForm, CancellationForm).

Inheritance: All forms inherit from the base Form class.

Polymorphism: Consistent event handling across forms.

Abstraction: Simplified user interaction without exposing internal logic.

🗃️ Database Design
Database: Oracle

Tables: TrainTbl, PassengerTbl, TravelTbl, ReservationTbl, CancellationTbl

ER Diagram: Clearly defines relationships between passengers, trains, reservations, and cancellations.

Security: Parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.

🖥️ Features
